* GraphMap algorithms standalone implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the graph collection
algorithms for ECAL SuperClustering.

The *GraphMap* class contains both the graph data structure and the
algorithms to extract final sub-graphs (called SuperClusters)

** Graph data structure
The graph is implemented in 3 objects.
+ For each node a list of incoming and outcoming edges are kept
+ the adjacency matrix of the graph is kept in memory as a map  {i,
  j}--> score

Nodes are distinguished in two categories:
+ cat=0:  normal nodes (clusters)
+ cat=1:  superNodes or seed, from where the collection algorithm
  starts

The adjency matrix score is provided externally, computed from the
DeepSC model.
